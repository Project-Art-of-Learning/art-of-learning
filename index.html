      <h2>Our mission</h2>
      <p>Here at Art of Learning, our mission is to provide all young students, regardless of their socioeconomic background, with the resources they need to cultivate a love for STEM and encourage them to pursue their interests in these fields.</p>
      
      <p>We aim to do this by providing tutoring and classes in Math, Computer Science, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and World Languages. As our society is becoming more reliant on technology, a strong foundation in STEM and problem solving will open countless opportunities for students.</p>
      
      <p>At the Art of Learning, we believe that long-term one-on-one instruction is the best solution to minimizing the opportunity gap in order to give students the tools to have a bright future.</p>

      <h2>One-on-one, free, online tutoring</h2>
      <p>Here at Art of Learning, we believe one-on-one tutoring sessions are the most effective way to give a student the chance to learn about their strengths and weaknesses. Our first session starts with a diagnosis.</p>
      
      <p>Using this diagnosis, our tutors choose which path to go on for the next session in order to provide students with the best tools to trailblaze their own path that is best for them.</p>
      
      <p>We value long term one-on-one mentorship as we believe this allows students and tutors to build a trust that fosters a learning environment with a growth mindset.</p>
