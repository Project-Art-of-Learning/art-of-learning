        "Ethan is a Junior at Del Norte High School. Growing up, he was always focused on STEM and participated in a myriad of competitions ranging from Science Olympiad to MATHCOUNTS. However, he discovered his passion for biology after taking AP Biology in his freshman year. Intrigued by the inner workings of the body and function of cells, he grew his passion for biology by co-founding Del Norte's Bio Club to both host the USABO and help other students prepare for it. Alongside the USABO, he also participated in the ARBC, AMC10, and programs such as OPALS. To not let other students face the same learning struggles he did when learning Science, Ethan has assisted in classes at different organizations and co-led other nonprofits providing science workshops for students in the United States. As the Head of Science at AOL, Ethan hopes to create easy-to-follow curricula for younger students and help educate students around the world in science."
